			Sample text cuz IDK what Mega wants to put here
			<br/> <!--This is a line break. YOu can copy paste this if you feel the link needs to be spaced out more-->
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" target="_blank">sample link cuz Im bored lel</a>
			<!--THIS IS A HYPERLINK!. I told you about this on Discord. What you need to do to replace this link with your mod link is delete the youtube video I put here and write JUST THE NAME OF YOUR MOD FOLDER.
			THAT'S IT. It's weird, I know, I think this is weird, but when someone clicks here, it will take a look atht eh folder name, open that up, and will automatically redirect tot he html page that is inside your build folder.
			To change the text that the hyperlink is associated, delete "sample link cuz Im bored lel" and type in whateveyou like here. DON't DELETE THE </a> container tag!!!-->
			<!--Fun fact: target="_blank" is a hyperlink attribute that tells the page to open a new tab automatically and load the URl of that hyperlink in that new tab. It's not required, but if you don't want to load
			the mod in a new tab, delete this attribute from this file.-->
